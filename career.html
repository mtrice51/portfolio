          <h2>What career do I want to go into?</h2>
          <p>I want a career in political science. Political science is the scientific study of politics. It is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political thought, political behavior, and associated constitutions and laws. I have always been interested in politics and public service. I found my passion for public service and politics in my elementary school. I took a very active role in my school becoming the Director of Student Services on the Student Voice Committee, student representative on the LSC, current Chair of the Prescott Allumni Association, and much more experience.</p>

          <h2>History of Political Science (in the US)</h2>
          <p>In the United States modern political science as a career did not begin to take shape until the latter half of the 19th century. Up until that point political science was often branched under political philosophy or history. Traditionally, political science was thought more of as political theology, political history, and moral philosophy. Now, political science focuses a lot on political economics, structure, and policy.</p>

          <h2>What are some applications of a Political Science Degree?</h2>
          <p>Political science degrees have many, many uses in the real world. One of the most common paths for people with political science degrees is to go into a government job where you can work as regulators, analists, managing international affairs, education, and more. Another path that many people go down and is a path I hope to take, is using a political science degree to get a law degree. With law degrees people often work as lawyers, judges, or even as elected officials. Political scientists also go on to work in the arts, education, and journalism. Political science is a degree that is increasing in popularity within the US. It is hard to say what the average political scientist makes in the US because of how many different ways there are to use a degree. On the lower end of political science degrees you can expect to be making around $40,000 per year on average, but it is not uncommon to see people with political science degrees making an upwards of $120,000 per year.</p>
